# Welcome To Rey Lab

ReyLab is committed to answering critical questions in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Specifically, we study the mechanisms of human episodic memory while searching for advanced methods of improving epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. To do this, we capture recordings of neural activity in the brains of patients with epilepsy using various methodologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), and single cell and local field potentials (LFP) from microwires.

Current ongoing projects aim to 1) understand human episodic memory, 2) improve the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, and 3) develop new tools for data acquisition and analysis of electrophysiological data in the human brain.
