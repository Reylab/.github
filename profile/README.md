# Welcome To Rey Lab

ReyLab is committed to answering critical questions in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Specifically, we study the mechanisms of human episodic memory while searching for advanced methods of improving epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. To do this, we capture recordings of neural activity in the brains of patients with epilepsy using various methodologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), and single cell and local field potentials (LFP) from microwires.

## Current Projects 
Our ongoing research focuses on the following key areas:
1. Understanding Human Episodic Memory: Investigating the underlying mechanisms of memory in the human brain.
2. Improving Epilepsy Diagnosis and Treatment: Developing more accurate diagnostic methods and innovative treatments for epilepsy.
3. Advancing Tools for Electrophysiological Data Acquisition and Analysis: Designing new tools to improve the collection and analysis of brain activity data.

Our Codes
--------
At ReyLab, we develop cutting-edge software tools aimed at enhancing the acquisition and analysis of neurophysiological data. We also share exemplary datasets to promote research collaboration and support advancements in various areas of neuroscience.

Currently, most of our code is written in MATLAB, but we are actively working on a Python version to increase accessibility and expand the functionality of our tools. We anticipate rolling out updates soon, and we are excited to continue improving and sharing these resources with the community.
